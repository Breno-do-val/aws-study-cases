# Introduction

## Cloud Computing and Virtualization

The technology that lies at the core of all cloud operations is virtualization.\
This technique lets you divide a single unit of hardware into smaller units running their own Operating System.

This is possible using a piece of software called `hypervisor`, in which there are two types,
_* Type 1*_ also known as _*Bear Metal virtualization *_, and _*Type 2*_ often called as _*Hosted*_.

## Virtual Machines x Containers

In VM's, virtualization occurs at the hardware level whereas Containerization occurs at the OS level.

## What is a container?

It's a standardized unit of software designed to run quickly and reliably on it computing environment.

## Cloud Computing Optimization

The cloud computing is a great choice because it's scalable, elastic and cost-effective. It offers you on-demand,
self-service access to pooled resources where the usage is metered and billed accordingly.

### Scalability

It meets increases in demand by automatically adding more resources.

### Elasticity

It increases the resources in high demand and reduce capacity when this demand drops.

### Cost Management

It transitions your IT expenditure from CAPEX framework to something closer to OPEX.
This means you don't need to spend a certain amount of money up front for every resource.
